# Gaussian Processes for Incremental Loss Ratios

This repository provides the code for the paper "Gaussian Process Models for Incremental Loss Ratios" by Mike Ludkovski and Howard Zail to be published in the Variance Journal.

There are two notebooks which can be run, one for the individual company models and one for the multi company models.  Each of these notebokes provide references to the models and code used.


# Individual Company Model

# Multi Company Model
